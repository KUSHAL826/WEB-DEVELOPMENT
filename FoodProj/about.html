            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>
                We are a home-based food powder preparation and supply unit dedicated to providing
                pure, hygienic, and traditionally prepared spice powders to our local community.
                All our products are prepared at home in small batches using traditional methods.
            </p>

            <p>
                We carefully select high-quality raw ingredients, clean them thoroughly, and follow
                natural drying processes to preserve flavour, aroma, and nutritional value.
                No artificial colours, preservatives, or chemicals are added at any stage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each batch is prepared with personal care and attention to ensure freshness and
                consistent taste. Since production is limited, customers always receive freshly
                prepared products rather than mass-produced items.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our focus is on quality over quantity. We believe good food starts with honest
                ingredients and clean preparation, making our powders suitable for everyday cooking
                and traditional recipes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, we supply only within Kallembella Hobli, Sira Taluk, Tumakuru District,
                allowing us to maintain freshness and direct customer trust. More homemade products
                will be introduced in the future based on demand.
            </p>
